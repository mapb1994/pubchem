PubChem uses the Hill system whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

PubChem uses the Hill system whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

An astrignent is a chemical that tends to shrink or constrict body tissues, usually locally after topical medicinal application.  The shrinkage or constriction is through osmotic flow of water (or other fluids) away from the area where the astringent was applied.  Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin. Acne sufferers are often advised to use astringents if they have oily skin. Astringents also help heal stretch marks and other scars. Mild astringent solutions are used in the relief of such minor skin irritations as those resulting from superficial cuts, allergies, insect bites, or fungal infections such as athlete's foot.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

PubChem uses the Hill system whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

PubChem uses the Hill system whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to \"octanol/water partition coefficients\", unless indicated otherwise.",

In microsomes, (CS2) metabolism was increased by phenobarbital pretreatment of the rats and decreased with pretreatment of the rats with cobaltous chloride. In both microsomes and hepatocytes, CS2 metabolism was inhibited by SKF-525A. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was the major volatile metabolite of CS2 in hepatocytes, and carbonyl sulfide (COS) was the major volatile metabolite in microsomal incubations. Addition of cytosol to microsomal incubations shifted the predominant volatile metabolite from COS to CO2 but did not change total volatile metabolite formation. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, significantly decreased COS metabolism but not CS2 metabolism in isolated hepatocytes or microsomes fortified with dialyzed cytosol. When [(18)O]H2O was included in incubations of microsomes and CS2, a substantial portion of the resulting COS was [(18)O] enriched.",

It is very soluble in water. USE: Carbonyl sulfide is an important commercial chemical. It is used to make certain herbicides and other chemicals. It is also used to fumigate grain in some countries. It is currently not registered for fumigant use in the US. EXPOSURE: Carbonyl sulfide is a component in the natural sulfur cycle. It is the most abundant sulfur compound in the atmosphere. It occurs in the atmosphere from reactions by other compounds with sunlight. It is released to the atmosphere from natural sources like salt marshes, soil, plant roots, manure, compost, microorganisms and volcanoes. It is also produced by man-made sources like diesel engines, natural gas and refinery emissions, coal-fired power plants, fish processing, making synthetic fibers, burning trash and biogas processes. Workers who use carbonyl sulfide may breathe in vapors or have direct skin contact. The general population may be exposed by breathing in air and smoking cigarettes. If carbonyl sulfide is released to the environment, it will be broken down in air over several years. It is not expected be broken down by sunlight. It will move into air from moist soil and water surfaces. In water, it will break down gradually into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. It is expected to move through soil. It is not expected to build up in fish. RISK: Data on the potential for carbonyl sulfide to produce toxic effects in humans were not available. Inhalation data were considered inadequate for evaluation. Effects to the brain were reported in laboratory animals breathing in carbonyl sulfide. The central nervous system is affected as indicated by lack of coordination, circling, head tilting, tremors and convulsions at extremely high inhalation doses. Death occurred in some animals. No effects were reported at much lower dose inhalation exposures over time. Data on the potential for carbonyl sulfide to cause cancer, infertility, abortion, or birth defects in laboratory animals were not available. The potential for carbonyl sulfide to cause cancer in humans has not been assessed by the U.S. EPA IRIS program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program 14th Report on Carcinogens.

CSIRO and BOC have agreed to commercialize ethanedinitrile (EDN) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) as alternatives for methyl bromide which is being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. EDN will initially be targeted to soil timber and devitilization of grain application in the label submitted with the registration data while COS is targeted to fumigation of durables. Applications targeting quarantine issues are being developed and will be added to the label as accepted by quarantines authorities. Data for registration was submitted in June 2005 to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) and the process is progressing. Negotiations for the supply of both fumigants are underway. BOC plan on introduce these alternatives, initially into the South Pacific market, to satisfy the needs of growers, fumigators and producers who have been willing to participate in the development phase. The driver for this has been due to problems being experienced with many of the current replacements for methyl bromide.",

CSF is ideal for the investigation of markers of brain injury or disease since it is secreted from several central nervous system structures and changes in the CSF composition may reflect brain insult and many pathological processes. Animals were placed in exposure chambers and were exposed to 0 ppm or 500 ppm COS for 1, 2 or 3 days, 6 hr per day. After the last inhalation exposure, 50-70 uL CSF sample was obtained by lumbar puncture. CSF samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) on either a Premier quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) or an Agilent 6340 ion trap and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS on a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzer. The dynamic range of abundance of the identified proteins spanned over more than three orders of magnitude. The four most abundant proteins identified (albumin, cystatin C, serotransferrin, transthyretin) are major proteins that are present in both CSF and blood at high levels but the fifth most abundant protein identified (prostaglandin H2D isomerase) is the second most abundant protein in human CSF and is secreted and synthesized in the rat central nervous system. No significant differences were observed between COS-treated CSF samples and the control CSF samples because of blood contamination. Quantitative MS protein analyses of rat CSF is limited by the low sample volumes that can practicably be obtained from rats and the low protein concentrations in rat CSF ...",

Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; give artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device. Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing and shoes. In case of contact with substance, immediately flush skin or eyes with running water for at least 20 minutes. In case of contact with liquefied gas, thaw frosted parts with lukewarm water. In case of burns, immediately cool affected skin for as long as possible with cold water. Do not remove clothing if adhering to skin. Keep victim calm and warm. Keep victim under observation. Effects of contact or inhalation may be delayed. (ERG, 2016)",

SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray or alcohol-resistant foam.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray, fog or alcohol-resistant foam. FOR CHLOROSILANES, DO NOT USE WATER; use AFFF alcohol-resistant medium-expansion foam. Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk. Damaged cylinders should be handled only by specialists.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. (ERG, 2016)",

All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded. Fully encapsulating, vapor-protective clothing should be worn for spills and leaks with no fire. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. FOR CHLOROSILANES, use AFFF alcohol-resistant medium-expansion foam to reduce vapors. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. (ERG, 2016)",

In microsomes, (CS2) metabolism was increased by phenobarbital pretreatment of the rats and decreased with pretreatment of the rats with cobaltous chloride. In both microsomes and hepatocytes, CS2 metabolism was inhibited by SKF-525A. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was the major volatile metabolite of CS2 in hepatocytes, and carbonyl sulfide (COS) was the major volatile metabolite in microsomal incubations. Addition of cytosol to microsomal incubations shifted the predominant volatile metabolite from COS to CO2 but did not change total volatile metabolite formation. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, significantly decreased COS metabolism but not CS2 metabolism in isolated hepatocytes or microsomes fortified with dialyzed cytosol. When [(18)O]H2O was included in incubations of microsomes and CS2, a substantial portion of the resulting COS was [(18)O] enriched.",

It is used as grain fumigant, and for small-scale synthesis and experiments. HUMAN STUDIES: There are no data available. ANIMAL STUDIES: Carbonyl sulfide is an odorless gas that produces highly reproducible lesions in the central nervous system. Carbonyl sulfide produced cortical and brainstem lesions and altered auditory neurophysiological responses to click stimuli in rats. In rats exposed to 500 or 600 ppm for up to 4 days, malacia and microgliosis were detected in numerous neuroanatomical regions of the brain by conventional optical microscopy and magnetic resonance microscopy. After a 2-week exposure to 400 ppm slight gait abnormality was detected in 50% of the rats and hypotonia was present in all rats. Continuous exposure of rabbits to approximately 50 ppm carbonyl sulfide for 7 weeks slightly elevated the mean serum cholesterol concentration. Serum triglyceride concentration was largely unaffected. Carbon sulfide is neither genotoxic nor a developmental toxicant but does reversibly impair male fertility. A decrease in pregnancy rate was observed in unexposed female rats mated with male rats exposed to 182 ppm carbonyl sulfide 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 10 weeks and 6 hours/day, 7 days/week for a 3-week mating period. When the males were allowed to recover for 10 weeks prior to mating to unexposed females, no alterations in fertility were observed. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In insects, carbonic anhydrase has a key role in toxicity of carbonyl sulfide.",

Further, exposure was performed to 0.5 ppm hydrogen cyanide alone or in combination with 200 ppm carbon monoxide or with 200 ppm carbon monoxide and 5 ppm nitric oxide and eventually to 50 ppm carbonyl sulfide. Duration of the continuous exposures were between 1/2 week and 12 weeks. Using the same criteria for intimal damage as in earlier morphological studies, no histotoxic effect on intimal/subintimal morphology of coronary arteries or the aorta could be demonstrated, when light-microscopic evaluation was performed blindly.",

It was developed as a potential alternative to methyl bromide, which is being phased out because of its ozone-depletion properties. To understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms occurring in fungal pathogens in response to COS fumigation, we cloned 510 cDNA fragments of Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler genes that are differentially expressed; these genes were cloned using suppression subtractive hybridization. Changes in the levels of transcripts of 79 fragments were confirmed by microarray analysis and qRT-PCR. Further homology search revealed that they are highly homologous to 41 genes of other fungi, which were related to general metabolism, growth and division, defense, cellular transport, and signal transduction. These results provide an overview of differential expression profiles of A. alternata genes following COS treatment and some new clues about the mechanism of COS fungitoxicity.",

Here we explored the affinity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase for its natural substrate CO(2), as well as COS and CS(2) (1) by in vitro kinetic metabolism studies using pure enzyme and (2) through mortality bioassay of insects exposed to toxic levels of each of the gases during carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Hydrolysis of COS to form hydrogen sulfide was catalyzed rapidly showing parameters K(m) 1.86 mM and K(cat) 41 s(-1) at 25 degrees C; however, the specificity constant (K(cat)/K(m)) was 4000-fold lower than the reported value for carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO(2). Carbonic anhydrase-mediated CS(2) metabolism was a further 65,000-fold lower than COS. Both results demonstrate the deactivating effect toward the enzyme of sulfur substitution for oxygen in the molecule. We also investigated the role of carbonic anhydrases in CO(2), COS and CS(2) toxicity using a specific inhibitor, acetazolamide, administered to Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) larvae via the diet. CO(2) toxicity was greatly enhanced by up to seven-fold in acetazolamide-treated larvae indicating that carbonic anhydrases are a key protective enzyme in elevated CO(2) concentrations. Conversely, mortality was reduced by up to 12-fold in acetazolamide-treated larvae exposed to COS due to reduced formation of toxic hydrogen sulfide. CS(2) toxicity was unaffected by acetazolamide. These results show that carbonic anhydrase has a key role in toxicity of the substrates CO(2) and COS but not CS(2), despite minor differences in chemical formulae.",

Its former use in the US as a grain fumigant resulted in its direct release to the environment. Carbonyl sulfide may be released to the atmosphere from deciduous trees, volcanoes, coniferous trees, salt marshes and soils. It may also be released to the environment as a fugitive emission from commercial processes and combustion emissions. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.41X10+3 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates carbonyl sulfide will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase carbonyl sulfide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours. Carbonyl sulfide did not absorb UV light at environmental wavelengths >290nm and, therefore, photolysis in the troposphere is negligible. If released to soil, carbonyl sulfide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.61 atm-cu m/mole. Carbonyl sulfide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, carbonyl sulfide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to carbonyl sulfide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where carbonyl sulfide is produced or used. Carbonyl sulfide is ubiquitous in the atmosphere. Monitoring data indicate that the general population will be exposed to carbonyl sulfide via inhalation of ambient air and smoking cigarettes.

Total biogenic and anthropogenic output to the atmosphere can be estimated at 3 millions tons(1). Emissions of carbonyl sulfide have been associated with deciduous trees, coniferous trees, salt marshes and soils(2). The mean carbonyl sulfide emissions from a hardwood forest were 8.66 ug S/day and 19.86 ug S/day from a pine forest; the emission rate increased dramatically after the addition of fertilizer(3). The average emission of carbonyl sulfide from 5 different soil types was found to range from 0.0014 to 6.36 g S/cu m-yr(4).",

The compounds were sampled by cryogenic technique and measured by subsequent gas chromatography/flame photometric detector analysis. Besides soil type, soil temperature is a major factor controlling carbonyl sulfide source strength. The emission of carbonyl sulfide does not show any clear dependence upon soil moisture, its fraction is about 35 to 40% of the total emission at all sampling sites. Dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide were the predominant gases emitted from organic soils. Carbonyl sulfide maximum emission rates reached 50 ng sulfur/sq m/min. Measurements of the diurnal variations of emission rates show daily patterns of dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide emission rates which coincide with the soil temperature curve. Sulfur fluxes of carbonyl sulfide from soil treated with liquid manure were enhanced by a factor of 5 to 6 compared to unfertilized soil of the same type(1).",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hrs and 3 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.33(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 22 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(SRC). Carbonyl sulfide is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). The compound reacts slowly with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide(3). Carbonyl sulfide did not absorb UV light at environmental wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, photolysis in the troposphere is negligible(4).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that carbonyl sulfide is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3 days(SRC). Carbonyl sulfide's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of carbonyl sulfide from dry soil surfaces will exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

It was identified, not quantified, in one out of sixty-three effluent samples obtained from a wide range of chemical manufacturing plants in the USA(3). The tropospheric burden of carbonyl sulfide is estimated as 28 teragrams sulfur per year (Tg S/yr)(4). Estimated emissions of carbonyl sulfide from anthropogenic sources are 0.20 Tg/yr (range 0.4-0.15 (Tg/yr) from biomass burning and 0.06 Tg/yr (0.01-0.3 Tg/yr) from automobiles, chemical industries and sulfur recovery processes(5). Carbonyl sulfide concentration in biogas ranged from <1 to in Nov and Dec 2000 to 3, 9 and 2 g/cu cm in Feb, May 2001 and May 2002, respectively, from a biogas production plant in Linkoping, Sweden. Emissions prior to upgrade range from <1 to 1190 g/cu m(6). The compound as included in a sulfur compounds class was reported in gaseous emissions inside an unspecified mechanical biological treatment plant for municipal solid waste located in China. It was not detected in outdoor samples. The plant has a 1200 t/day capacity(7).",

COS is a tracer with which to quantify terrestrial photosynthesis based on the coupled leaf uptake of COS and CO2, but such use requires separating soil COS flux, which is unrelated to photosynthesis, from ecosystem COS uptake. For CO, soil is a significant natural sink that influences the tropospheric CO budget. In the boreal forest, magnitudes and variabilities of soil COS and CO fluxes remain poorly understood. We measured hourly soil fluxes of COS, CO, and CO2 over the 2015 late growing season (July to November) in a Scots pine forest in Hyytiala, Finland. The soil acted as a net sink of COS and CO, with average uptake rates around 3 pmol-sq m/sec for COS and 1 nmol-sq m/sec for CO. Soil respiration showed seasonal dynamics controlled by soil temperature, peaking at around 4 umol-sq m/sec in late August and September and dropping to 1- 2 umol-sq m/sec in October. In contrast, seasonal variations of COS and CO fluxes were weak and mainly driven by soil moisture changes through diffusion limitation. COS and CO fluxes did not appear to respond to temperature variation, although they both correlated well with soil respiration in specific temperature bins. However, COS:CO2 and CO:CO2 flux ratios increased with temperature, suggesting possible shifts in active COS- and CO-consuming microbial groups. Our results show that soil COS and CO fluxes do not have strong variations over the late growing season in this boreal forest and can be represented with the fluxes during the photosynthetically most active period. Well-characterized and relatively invariant soil COS fluxes strengthen the case for using COS as a photosynthetic tracer in boreal forests(1).",

We report the first direct measurements to our knowledge of the ecosystem flux of OCS throughout an annual cycle, at a mixed temperate forest. The forest took up OCS during most of the growing season with an overall uptake of 1.36 mol OCS per ha (43.5 g S per ha, 95% confidence intervals) for the year. Daytime fluxes accounted for 72% of total uptake. Both soils and incompletely closed stomata in the canopy contributed to nighttime fluxes. Unexpected net OCS emission occurred during the warmest weeks in summer. Many requirements necessary to use fluxes of OCS as a simple estimate of photosynthesis were not met because OCS fluxes did not have a constant relationship with photosynthesis throughout an entire day or over the entire year. However, OCS fluxes provide a direct measure of ecosystem-scale stomatal conductance and mesophyll function, without relying on measures of soil evaporation or leaf temperature, and reveal previously unseen heterogeneity of forest canopy processes. Observations of OCS flux provide powerful, independent means to test and refine land surface and carbon cycle models at the ecosystem scale.",

COS mixing ratios exhibited distinct seasonal variation, with a maximum average value of 849 +/- 477 pptv in winter and a minimal value of 372 +/- 115 pptv in summer. The seasonal variation of COS was mainly ascribed to the combined effects of vegetation uptake and anthropogenic emissions. Two types of significant linear correlations (R2>0.66) were found between COS and CO during the periods from May to June and from October to March, with slopes (deltaCOS/deltaCO) of 0.72 and 0.14 pptv/ppbv, respectively. Based on the emission ratios of COS/CO from various sources, the dominant anthropogenic sources of COS in Beijing were found to be vehicle tire wear in summer and coal burning in winter. The total anthropogenic emission of COS in Beijing was roughly estimated as 0.53 +/- 0.02 Gg/year based on the local CO emission inventory and the deltaCOS/deltaCO ratios.",

PubChem uses the Hill system whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers. To learn information to each UN/NA number, refer to the Emergency Response Guidebook (https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/erg/emergency-response-guidebook-erg).",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Five domestic swine underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA), conventional CT angiography with iodinated contrast material, and CO(2)-enhanced CT arteriography. For each CO(2)-enhanced DSA image series, 100 mL of pressurized CO(2) was injected at 1.3 bar. CT imaging was performed according to a standardized scan protocol (2 x 32 x 0.6 mm; 120 kV, 210 mAs(eff), 330 msec gantry rotation time). Iodinated contrast material was administered intravenously according to a biphasic injection protocol. For CO(2)-enhanced CT arteriography, CO(2) was administered intraarterially via a catheter placed in the juxtarenal aorta. An injection pressure of 0.65 bar (volume flow rate, 7.5 mL/sec) was applied. Images were assessed visually by two observers on a four-point grading scale. Absolute intraarterial attenuation values were measured.  Image quality was rated to be the best for standard DSA. CO(2)-enhanced DSA was rated slightly superior to CO(2)-enhanced CT arteriography. No examination was considered to be nondiagnostic. The average multislice spiral CT (MSCT) scan duration was 7.9 sec +/- 0.6. The average amount of gas required for CO(2)-enhanced CT arteriography was 104 mL +/- 4, compared with 400 mL for CO(2)-enhanced DSA. Absolute attenuation values were significantly higher with CO(2)-enhanced CT arteriography (aorta, -928 HU +/- 39) than with standard CT angiography (490 HU +/- 40; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: CO(2)-enhanced CT arteriography is feasible. In a porcine model, this technique is capable of depicting the aortoperipheral vessels down to the lower limb. These results warrant further studies of the diagnostic value of CO(2)-enhanced MSCT arteriography for the detection of arterial pathologic processes.",

Immediately after ultrasonography, the ultrasound quality of the liver, gallbladder, biliary ducts, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, abdominal vessels, antrum, bowel, urinary bladder and prostate/uterus was evaluated for optimal ultrasound scanning quality, minor reduction of scanning conditions, major reduction of scanning conditions and unacceptable scanning conditions. Ultrasound quality 30 min after colonoscopy was significantly better when using CO(2) insufflation instead of air (p<0.003). Significant improvement in imaging quality was observed for the liver, portal vein, splenic vein, all three divisions of the pancreas, aorta, coeliac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, iliac vessels, left kidney and uterus. Ultrasound investigation can be done after a colonoscopy with CO(2) insufflation, whereas it is not recommended after a colonoscopy with air insufflation. In selected cases, this approach may enable and improve post-colonoscopy ultrasound scanning.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

An average adult human will produce more than 500 g of carbon dioxide daily under resting conditions, and will produce much more when active. Additional carbon dioxide has several effects on the body, and responses are immediate. It stimulates breathing, which exhales the carbon dioxide carried to the lungs from the cells by the bloodstream. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration stimulates the heart rate, increases the blood pressure, increases adrenalin flow, and relaxes the vascular smooth muscles. In addition, carbon dioxide reacts with water in the body to form carbonic acid, which dissociates to hydrogen ion and bicarbonate. An increase in carbon dioxide in the body increases acidity, and then the kidneys act to restore normal acidity.",

These studies assess the effects of altering pyruvate metabolism in 3-5 somite mouse embryos in whole embryo culture. ... To establish that pyruvate is metabolized during organogenesis the rates of (14)C-carbon dioxide production from 3-(14)C-pyruvate by conceptuses in vitro were measured on days 9-12. The rates of carbon dioxide production incr with incr gestational age. ... The rate of carbon dioxide production from pyruvate by day 10 yolk sac was 10 times greater than that by the embryo proper. Fluoroacetate produced a time and concn dependent reduction in carbon dioxide production in day 10 conceptuses. These studies demonstrate that pyruvate is metabolized by Krebs cycle during organogenesis. alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate inhibits transport of pyruvate from cytosol to mitochondria. Embryos exposed to alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate exhibited neural tube defects (11/12 at 1,000 uM). Thus, alterations of utilization of pyruvate is teratogenic to cultured embryos. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inhibited via phosphorylation by E1-kinase. Dichloroacetate inhibits e1-kinase resulting incr pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and incr metabolism of pyruvate by Krebs cycle. Dichloroacetate produced neural tube defects in 0/12 embryos at 100 uM and 6/15 embryos at 500 uM. ... Pyruvate is metabolized during organogenesis and that proper regulation of pyruvate is metabolized during organogenesis and that proper regulation of pyruvate transport and metabolism is essential for normal development.",

Despite of the fact, that this effect is used in industrial sterilization processes, the sterilization mechanism at molecular level is unclear. Our hypotheses can provide a molecular-biological explanation for the phenomenon. We believe that in supercritical state CO(2) reacts competitively with Met-tRNA(fMet), the formation rate and the amount of formyl-methionyl-tRNA (fMet-tRNA(fMet)) will be diminished by irreversible substrate consumption. The fMet-tRNA(fMet) possesses a key role in prokaryotic protein synthesis, being almost exclusively the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA. The formed carbamoyl-methionyl-tRNA (cMet-tRNA(fMet)), probably stable only under pressure and high CO(2) concentration, is stabilized by forming a ternary molecular complex with the GTP-form of the translational initiation factor 2 (GTP-IF2). This complex is unable to dissociate from preinitiation 70S ribosomal complex because of strong polar binding between the protein C-2 domain and the modified initiator aminoacyl-tRNA. The IF2-fMet-tRNA(fMet)-blocked 70S ribosomal preinitiation complex does not decompose following the GTP hydrolysis, becoming unable to synthesize proteins. The death of the microbial cell is caused by inhibition of the protein synthesis and energetic depletion. Moreover, we propose a possible mechanism for the accumulation of cMet-tRNA(fMet) in the bacterial cell. Since the translational process is an important target for antibiotics, the proposed mechanism could be a work hypothesis for discovery of new antibiotics. Made by high conservative character of prokaryotic translation initiation, the proposed IF2 pathway deterioration strategy may conduct to obtaining selective (with low mammalian toxicity) antimicrobials and at the same time, with reduced possibility of the drug resistance development.",

Animals can respond to both absolute CO2 concentrations and changes in CO2 levels within seconds. Responses to CO2 do not reflect avoidance of acid pH but appear to define a new sensory response. Sensation of CO2 is promoted by the cGMP-gated ion channel subunits TAX-2 and TAX-4, but other pathways are also important. Robust CO2 avoidance in well fed animals requires inhibition of the DAF-16 forkhead transcription factor by the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Starvation, which activates DAF-16, strongly suppresses CO2 avoidance. Exposure to hypoxia (<1% O2) also suppresses CO2 avoidance via activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. The npr-1 215V allele of the naturally polymorphic neuropeptide receptor npr-1, besides inhibiting avoidance of high ambient O2 in feeding C. elegans, also promotes avoidance of high CO2. C. elegans integrates competing O2 and CO2 sensory inputs so that one response dominates. Food and allelic variation at NPR-1 regulate which response prevails. These results suggest that multiple sensory inputs are coordinated by C. elegans to generate different coherent foraging strategies.",

Carbon dioxide is a component of all flue gases produced by the complete combustion of carbonaceous fuels. Typical concentrations of carbon dioxide in such gases are 10 - 18 vol%. ... The flue gases, after being cooled and cleaned by passing through a water scrubber, are passed through an alkaline carbonate solution or an amine solution which absorbs carbon dioxide. Unlike carbon dioxide from an ammonia plant, the product obtained from flue gases is generally contaminated with small amounts of sulfur compounds. Although manufacture of carbon dioxide by this method was once of a considerable commercial importance, it is now seldom economically viable. It is, however, being revived in the United States for enhanced oil recovery projects, which require vast quantities of CO2.",

Before being suitable for further use, however, the carbon dioxide must be freed of the impurities inherent in this method of manufacture, i.e., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and various organic compounds such as aldehydes, acids, and higher alcohols and diols. Two general methods are available to purify fermentation carbon dioxide. Both use water scrubbers to remove the bulk of the entrained material. The impurities are then taken out by passing through either an activated charcoal bed or solutions of potassium permanganate and potassium dichromate. The first method relies on adsorption, whereas the second involves chemical reactions. In the second case the gas must be treated further downstream to remove oxidation products formed in the earlier stages as well as any traces of the reagents used in the purification.",

In 2013, CO2 accounted for about 82% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's carbon cycle (the natural circulation of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, plants, and animals). Human activities are altering the carbon cycle-both by adding more CO2 to the atmosphere and by influencing the ability of natural sinks, like forests, to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While CO2 emissions come from a variety of natural sources, human-related emissions are responsible for the increase that has occurred in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation, although certain industrial processes and land-use changes also emit CO2. The main sources of CO2 emissions in the United States are ... electricity ... transportation ... /and/ industry.",

The most advanced carbon capture technology is CO2 absorption using amine-based solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA). However, there is concern that the increased use of amine-based solvents will lead to other potential negative environmental impacts, such as increased human toxicity. The use of benign inorganic solvents, such as potassium carbonate, which do not degrade in the presence of oxygen or other impurities such as sulfurous or nitrous oxides offer significant advantages over amine-based solvents in terms of environmental impact. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) between the use of MEA and the CO2CRC's potassium carbonate based UNO MK 3 technology for the capture of 1 ton of CO2 from a brown-coal fired power station has been completed. The results reveal that the UNO MK 3 process is significantly better than MEA on ecotoxicity and carcinogen emissions and substantially better on all other indicators. The benefits of the UNO MK 3 process compared with MEA are due to avoidance of emissions from MEA degradation along with the savings in energy use for CO2 removal. The significant environmental benefits of the UNO MK 3 process compared with MEA were not altered by an uncertainty analysis or sensitivity analysis of key inputs and assumptions.",

Phase 1 consisted of a general overview of the performance of existing mechanical systems, including site inspections. A questionnaire was distributed to all building occupants in order to document the following: environmental problems, symptoms reported in the building, and in order to locate complaint areas for detailed monitoring. The second phase involved measuring carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide concentrations. Carbon dioxide was used as an indicator of contaminant build up generated indoors from occupants and equipment, and carbon monoxide as an indicator of combustion byproducts infiltrating from the outside, especially from parking garages. The third phase included measuring air exchange rates with tracer gas to determine total ventilation rates within the building and pattern of air movement through the building. As an example of applying the technique, results obtained in a four story, 10 year old sealed, mechanically ventilated, air conditioned office building were given. A four story office building that was 50 years old served as the comparison building. It was equipped with operable windows for ventilation and radiators for heat. Occupants of the study building reported a much higher prevalence of symptoms such as eye, nose, and throat irritation than occupants of the comparison building. carbon dioxide levels were significantly higher in the study than in the comparison building. Carbon monoxide concentrations were comparable in both buildings, but higher than those found in similar buildings. Supply of outside air to the first floor of the study building was adequate; however, ventilation system tests and reviewing building plans showed that other densely populated parts of the study building were poorly supplied with outside air due to problems with ventilation design and efficiency.",

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Allow substance to evaporate. Ventilate the area. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2016)",

This is especially true in the presence of strong oxidizers, such as peroxides. The presence of carbon dioxide in solutions of aluminum hydride in ether can cause violent decomposition on warming the residue, [J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1948, 70, 877]. Dangers arising from the use of carbon dioxide in the fire prevention and extinguishing systems of confined volumes of air and flammable vapors are examined. The hazard associated with its use centers around the fact that large electrostatic discharges may be created that initiate explosion, [Quart. Saf. Summ., 1973, 44(1740, 10]. Contact of very cold liquid/solid carbon dioxide with water may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container.

This is especially true in the presence of strong oxidizers, such as peroxides. The presence of carbon dioxide in solutions of aluminum hydride in ether can cause violent decomposition on warming the residue, [J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1948, 70, 877]. Dangers arising from the use of carbon dioxide in the fire prevention and extinguishing systems of confined volumes of air and flammable vapors are examined. The hazard associated with its use centers around the fact that large electrostatic discharges may be created that initiate explosion, [Quart. Saf. Summ., 1973, 44(1740, 10]. Contact with water of very cold liquid/solid carbon dioxide may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container. With water forms weak carbonic acid in nonhazardous reaction.",

If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container. With water forms weak carbonic acid in nonhazardous reaction. Dusts of magnesium, lithium, potassium, sodium, zirconium, titanium, and some magnesium-aluminum alloys, and heated aluminum, chromium, and magnesium when suspended in carbon dioxide are ignitable and explosive. This is especially true in the presence of strong oxidizers, such as peroxides. The presence of carbon dioxide in solutions of aluminum hydride in ether can cause violent decomposition on warming the residue, [J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1948, 70, 877]. Dangers arising from the use of carbon dioxide in the fire prevention and extinguishing systems of confined volumes of air and flammable vapors are examined. The hazard associated with its use centers around the fact that large electrostatic discharges may be created that initiate explosion, [Quart. Saf. Summ., 1973, 44(1740, 10].",

Ventilate closed spaces before entering. /Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide, compressed; Carbon dioxide, solid; Dry ice; Carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid/",

ECGs (n = 15) revealed ST-segment changes in 2 (13.3%) patients, atrial fibrillation in 2 patients, and non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 1 patient. Chest radiographs (n = 22) revealed diffuse or patchy alveolar patterns, consistent with pneumonitis, in 6 (27%) patients and pulmonary edema in 2 (9%) patients. Eleven (44%) patients were admitted to the hospital: 8 were discharged 24 hours later and the others within 8 days. No patient died. Exposure to high concentrations of carbon dioxide resulted in significant but transient cardiopulmonary morbidity with no mortality when victims were promptly evacuated and given supportive therapy. Cardiac complications were frequently observed and should be actively sought.",

The clinical findings in 845 survivors seen at or admitted to hospital were compatible with exposure to an asphyxiant gas. Rescuers noted cutaneous erythema and bullae on an unknown proportion of corpses and 161 (19%) survivors treated in hospital; though these lesions were initially believed to be burns from acidic gases, further investigation suggested that they were associated with coma states caused by exposure to carbon dioxide in air. The disaster at Lake Nyos and a similar event at Lake Monoun, Cameroon, two years previously provide new information on the possible medical effects of large scale emissions of carbon dioxide, though the presence of other toxic factors in these gas releases cannot be excluded.",

We show here that atmospheric CO(2) (concentration range studied: 40-1,000 ppm.) increases death rates due to H(2)O(2) stress in Escherichia coli in a dose-specific manner. This effect is correlated with an increase in H(2)O(2)-induced mutagenesis and, as shown by 8-oxo-guanine determinations in cells, DNA base oxidation rates. Moreover, the survival of mutants that are sensitive to aerobic conditions (Hpx(-) dps and recA fur), presumably because of their inability to tolerate ROS, seems to depend on CO(2) concentration. Thus, CO(2) exacerbates ROS toxicity by increasing oxidative cellular lesions.",

All animals were placed in a pressure chamber and maintained at 50 psig in 100% O2 until death. The tris buffer and NaHCO3 buffer significantly extended /the/ time to onset of convulsions and to time of death. Acetazolamide and also 5% CO2 shortened /the/ time of convulsions and significantly shortened survival time.

The cause of death in the animals exposed to hyperbaric O2 was pulmonary edema secondary to a systemic hypertension.",

Groups of six male Fischer rats were exposed for 30 minutes to carbon monoxide and CO2, either individually or in combination, or to the products of combustible materials. Exposure to carbon monoxide in air caused death within the first minute at concentrations of 4600 to 5000 ppm, which gave carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 83%. With 2500 ppm carbon monoxide, blood pH decreased from 7.42 to 7.2. The CO2 concentrations tested (1.3 to 14.7%) were neither incapacitating nor lethal. When CO2 was added to sublethal concentrations of carbon monoxide, some of the rats died during either the 30 minute exposure period or in the following 24 hours. The rate of formation of carboxyhemoglobin from an exposure to 2500 ppm carbon monoxide was 1.5 times greater in the presence of 5.25% CO2. However, this could not explain the increased death rate, since the carboxyhemoglobin equilibrium level (78%) did not change. The combination of 2500 ppm carbon monoxide and 5.25% CO2 reduced the blood pH to 6.8. With the combined gases, the total CO2 and bicarbonate values remained low for at least 30 minutes after exposure indicating that a combination of respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurred in animals exposed to both gases. Carbon monoxide, CO2 and carboxyhemoglobin levels produced as a result of thermal combustion of 11 natural and synthetic materials at their median lethal concentrations were measured. Only polyphenylsulfone produced sufficient carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin levels to suggest carbon monoxide as the primary toxicant. For the other materials the carbon monoxide concentration was too low to account for the deaths observed. It was concluded that in the range of 2500 to 4100 ppm, carbon monoxide alone has very little probability of causing death, but if it is combined with levels of CO2 above 1.5 % the probability of death is much higher.",

It is registered for pesticide use in the U.S. but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. Carbon dioxide is used as a pesticide for insect control in stored grain under modified atmospheres containing approx. 60% carbon dioxide. It is also used as rodenticide (mice and rats). Other uses include refrigeration, carbonated beverages, aerosol propellant, chemical intermediate (carbonates, synthetic fibers, p-xylene, etc.), low-temperature testing, fire extinguishing, inert atmospheres, municipal water treatment, medicine, enrichment of air in greenhouses, fracturing and acidizing of oil wells, mining (Cardox method), miscible pressure source, hardening of foundry molds and cores, shielding gas for welding, cloud seeding, moderator in some types of nuclear reactors, immobilization for humane animal killing, special lasers, blowing agent, as demulsifier in tertiary oil recovery, possible source of methane, (liquid) carrier for powdered-coal slurry. Supercritical or liquid CO2 used in extraction of caffeine and hops aroma; dry cleaning; metal degreasing; cleaning semiconductor chips; paint spraying; polymer modification. Carbon dioxide is used in hydraulic fracturing. CO2 is also used as medication during surgical procedures. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Carbon dioxide is produced by the body's metabolism and is always present in the body at about 6% concentration. An average adult human will produce more than 500 g of carbon dioxide daily under resting conditions, and will produce much more when active. The gas is a weak CNS depressant at 30,000 ppm, giving rise to reduced acuity of hearing and increasing blood pressure and pulse. Exposure at 7%-10% produces unconsciousness within a few minutes. At low concentrations, gaseous carbon dioxide appears to have little toxicological effect. At higher concentrations it leads to an increased respiratory rate, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and impaired consciousness. Concentrations >10% may cause convulsions, coma and death. Solid carbon dioxide may cause burns following direct contact. If it is warmed rapidly, large amounts of carbon dioxide are generated, which can be dangerous, particularly within confined areas. Carbon dioxide at high concentration in air causes stinging sensation in eyes, nose, and throat. Asphyxiation with CO2 is said to have induced temporary proptosis and mydriasis and caused yellow vision, with transient blindness. Severe damage of CNS and retinal ganglion cells has been reported. ANIMAL STUDIES: Inhalation of air containing 68% carbon dioxide for 5 min caused death from asphyxia in pigs. Dogs were given 30% carbon dioxide for 2 hr, then 40% carbon dioxide, and then abruptly returned to normal air. Eleven dogs died within 10 min with ventricular fibrillation. Four survived with cardiac arrhythmias, and two had no cardiac symptoms. Rats exposed to an atmosphere containing 50% carbon dioxide died within 6 hr. Rats exposed to 25% died within 36 hr. Deaths were a result of pulmonary injury. Atmospheres as low as 20% carbon dioxide caused cerebral depression. All rats exposed to 10% carbon dioxide survived. Guinea pigs exposed to 15% carbon dioxide for 7 days lost weight at first but later returned to normal weight. They also had higher blood corticosteroids, lower adrenal epinephrine, decreased adrenal cholesterol, higher arterial free fatty acids, and decreased lymphocytes in the first 3 days of exposure. No effects were seen in male rhesus monkeys that spent 93 days in an atmosphere with 3% carbon dioxide. Toxicity to fertility (morphological changes of spermatozoa in mice at 1% and testicular changes in rats at 2.5%) and teratogenicity (cardiac and skeletal abnormalities in rats at 6%; skeletal abnormalities in rabbits at 10%) were observed. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Harmful to some species of aquatic life in concentrations less than 20 mg/L. Adult and larval insects are rapidly anesthetized by carbon dioxide. Groups of caged, queenless Apis mellifera (honeybee) workers narcotized with CO(2) on consecutive days early in adult life showed a significantly lower level of ovary activation than did groups of untreated workers. This same experimental treatment, by contrast, is known to accelerate ovary activation and induce egg laying in virgin honey bee queens--an observation that suggests that CO(2) narcosis has contrasting effects in queen versus worker ovary activation. Elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a consequence of anthropogenic global change, can profoundly affect the interactions between crop plants and insect pests and may promote yet another form of global change: the rapid establishment of invasive species.",

A constant addition of 150 (or 200) mL/min pure carbon dioxide (CO2) to the inspirate (7 subjects) and 230 mL of added dead space (5 subjects) were the two respiratory loads. Inspiratory ventilation was measured by pneumotachygraph for at least five continuous min in wakefulness, slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. The incr in ventilation to both stimuli was equal in slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep with no suggestion of an impaired response during the latter: incr in ventilation during CO2 loading being 49 and 51%, slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, respectively, and during additional dead space they were 53 and 59%, slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, respectively. Following the addition of extra dead space, end tidal P(CO2) levels did not rise significantly more during rapid eye movement sleep compared to slow wave sleep (p > 0.5).",

Blood flow was computed from the concn history of xenon-133 in the volume of interest measured with an ultrapure germanium detector array. End tidal arterial carbon dioxide tension ranged from 35.4 to 42.6 mm Hg. The mean +/- SD baseline blood flows in the cerebral cortex were 60 +/- 7, 51 +/- 9, and 33 +/- 4 mL/100 cu cm/min in the young, the middle aged, and the elderly subjects, respectively; the corresponding subcortical white matter baseline blood flows were 21 +/- 1, 22 +/- 3, and 16 +/- 5 mL/100 cu cm/min.

Age vs blood flow (for the cortex) and age vs cerebrovascular reactivity (for both cortical gray and subcortical white matter) also showed significant linear correlation (p < 0.05). However, the age related changes in white matter blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity were slow and the differences among the age groups were not statistically significant.",

Tracheal mucosa irritation was induced by injection of distilled water at 3 different levels of carbon dioxide ventilatory drive: resting level of spontaneous breathing (baseline, end-tidal CO2 partial pressure = 50 Torr), relative hypocapnia (end-tidal CO2 partial pressure = 35 Torr, where spontaneous respiratory activity disappeared), and relative hypercapnia (end-tidal CO2 partial pressure was raised to a level of 10 Torr above the baseline). With relative hypercapnia, water instillation caused only a brief apnea without any changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Although cough reflex, expiration reflex, and spasmodic panting were frequently observed during relative hypocapnia and baseline respiration, the occurrence of these responses was less frequent during relative hypercapnia. No significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate were observed before irritation of the tracheal mucosa at the 3 different levels of CO2 ventilatory drive. However under water stimulation, response durations of respiration, blood pressure and heart rate were all significantly longer at relative hypocapnia and were significantly shorter at relative hypercapnia, compared with the baseline values.",

CO(2) is naturally present in the atmosphere at the level of 0.038% and involved in numerous cellular biochemical reactions. We analyzed in vitro the inflammation response induced by exposure to CO(2) for 48 hr (0-20% with a constant O(2) concentration of 21%). In vivo mice were submitted to increasing concentrations of CO(2) (0, 5, 10, and 15% with a constant O(2) concentration of 21%) for 1 hr. The exposure to concentrations above 5% of CO(2) resulted in the increased transcription (RNase protection assay) and secretion (ELISA) of proinflammatory cytokines [macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, MIP-2, IL-8, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and, presumably, secreted (RANTES)] by epithelial cell lines HT-29 or A549 and primary pulmonary cells retrieved from the exposed mice. Lung inflammation was also demonstrated in vivo by mucin 5AC-enhanced production and airway hyperreactivity induction. This response was mostly mediated by the nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB, itself a consequence of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation. Short inhibiting RNAs (siRNAs) targeted toward PP2Ac reversed the effect of carbon dioxide, i.e., disrupted the NF-kappaB activation and the proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In conclusion, this study strongly suggests that exposure to carbon dioxide may be more toxic than previously thought ...",

To contribute to risk assessment of accidental release associated with handling, transport and storage, rats were exposed to high concentrations (targets 40, 43 and 50 volume %) of CO2. The oxygen concentrations dropped as a result, but were not supplemented. For each concentration, pairs of animals were exposed for different exposure durations to derive an exposure concentration-duration relation in which mortality is described as a function of C(n)x(t) (probit relation). A very high \"n\" value for the probit function could be derived from the data obtained at 40% and 43% CO2, which indicates that for exposure durations longer than 30 min the LC50 decreases hardly with increasing exposure duration. Below 30 min the LC50 seemed to increase with decreasing exposure durations. The variability in the data of 43% and 50% CO2, however, did not allow to derive a meaningful value of \"n\".",

However, the environmental effects of potential CO2 leaks remain largely unknown. The amphipod Ampelisca brevicornis was exposed to environmental sediments collected in different areas of the Gulf of Cadiz and subjected to several pH treatments to study the effects of CO2-induced acidification on sediment toxicity. After 10 days of exposure, the results obtained indicated that high lethal effects were associated with the lowest pH treatments, except for the Ria of Huelva sediment test. The mobility of metals from sediment to the overlying seawater was correlated to a pH decrease. The data obtained revealed that CO2-related acidification would lead to lethal effects on amphipods as well as the mobility of metals, which could increase sediment toxicity.",

However, storage leaks are possible resulting in several effects in the ecosystem. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of CO2 leakage on the fate of metals and on the growth of the microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Metal contaminated sediments were collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection or by adding HCl. Sediments elutriate were prepared to perform toxicity tests. The results showed that sediment acidification enhanced the release of metals to elutriates. Iron and zinc were the metals most influenced by this process and their concentration increased greatly with pH decreases. Diatom growth was inhibited by both processes: acidification and the presence of metals. Data obtained is this study is useful to calculate the potential risk of CCS activities to the marine environment.",

The process of ocean acidification is well documented in field data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidification alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying). The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2 and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well known; both are high priorities for future research. Although ocean pH has varied in the geological past, paleo-events may be only imperfect analogs to current conditions.",

Acidification is expected to reduce coral reef calcification and increase reef dissolution. Inorganic cementation in reefs describes the precipitation of CaCO(3) that acts to bind framework components and occlude porosity. Little is known about the effects of ocean acidification on reef cementation and whether changes in cementation rates will affect reef resistance to erosion. Coral reefs of the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) are poorly developed and subject to rapid bioerosion. Upwelling processes mix cool, subthermocline waters with elevated pCO(2) (the partial pressure of CO(2)) and nutrients into the surface layers throughout the ETP. Concerns about ocean acidification have led to the suggestion that this region of naturally low pH waters may serve as a model of coral reef development in a high-CO(2) world. We analyzed seawater chemistry and reef framework samples from multiple reef sites in the ETP and found that a low carbonate saturation state (Omega) and trace abundances of cement are characteristic of these reefs. These low cement abundances may be a factor in the high bioerosion rates previously reported for ETP reefs, although elevated nutrients in upwelled waters may also be limiting cementation and/or stimulating bioerosion. ETP reefs represent a real-world example of coral reef growth in low-Omega waters that provide insights into how the biological-geological interface of coral reef ecosystems will change in a high-CO(2) world.",

It is found that the southern oceans are a sink of carbon of 0.8 to 1.5 Gt/yr (1 Gt = 1 x 10 +15 g) and that the equatorial areas are a source to the atmosphere of 1.4 to 2.8 Gt.

Seasonal net ecosystem production north of 25 deg N is found to be 6.2 to 8.2 Gt of carbon. ...

Measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the Northern Hemisphere have shown an increase in the average concentrations from 290 ppm before 1900 to 330 ppm in the 1950's(2). The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing as increased amounts of fossil fuels are burned. There is some evidence that the rate of release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere may be greater than the earth's ability to assimilate it. US measurements show an increase of 1.36% of atmospheric carbon dioxide content in a five-year period, with indications that content may have increased by 25% as of 2003(3). In 2013, the gas  acounted for approximately 83% of all US greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide releases to the atmosphere in the United States increased by approximately 7% between 1990 and 2013. This increase corresponds with increased energy use by an expanding economy and populations, an overall growth in emissions from electricity operations, and an increase in miles traveled by motor vehicles(1).",

The amplitude of the seasonal cycle was found to be incr at a rate of 0.05 + or - 0.02 ppm/yr. The avg growth rate of CO2 was 1.42 + or - .02 ppm/yr, and the fraction of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion was 59%. A comparison between the Mauna Loa continuous CO2 data and the CO2 flask sample data from the sea level site at Cape Kumukahi, Hawaii, showed that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle at Cape Kumukahi was 23% larger than at Mauna Loa, with the phase of the cycle at Mauna Loa lagging the cycle at Cape Kumukahi by about 1-2 wk.",

The net amounts of CO2 taken up by the oceans and released from the biosphere between 1970 and 1990 have been determined from the changes in three measures values: the concentration of atmospheric CO2, the delta13C of atmospheric CO2 and the delta13C value of dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean.

In Subtropical regions, we observed partial pressure of carbon dioxide values almost 45 mu atm higher in summer than in winter. This variation is produced principally by the seasonal change of sea surface water temperature. In contrast, in the Subantarctic region, partial pressure of carbon dioxide values 25 mu atm lower in summer than in winter in response to the predominant seasonal biological activity were observed. This characteristic phase change of the seasonal oceanic surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide signal with latitude appears to be a global phenomenon and is mirrored in the northern hemisphere. A comparison with GEOSECS data shows good agreement between our total CO2 profiles and the earlier observations. In the southern region of the Antarctic convergence, both the measured and calculated partial pressure of carbon dioxide values agree with those of the GEOSECS program, and confirm that this region of the ocean is probably a source of CO2 to the atmosphere throughout the year.",

In the first building, CO2 levels increased from the ambient of 350 ppm in the morning, to between 800 and 900 ppm in heavily populated areas from mid morning to mid afternoon. The outside makeup air supply rate was 14 cubic feet per minute per employee, which was below the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers guidelines of 20 cubic feet per minute per employee. In the second building, the CO2 level increased to 1600 ppm during mid afternoon and the employees complained about stuffy air. In the third building the employees complained about respiratory problems, although the 24 hour cycle chart showed CO2 levels between 500 and 600 ppm, indicating an adequate air supply. However, the waterfall wash humidification system was loaded with slime and bacteria, as no bacteriacide had ever been used. In the fourth building spot checks revealed high CO2 levels, which were found to be due to an occupancy level problem. The occupancy on the main floor averaged less than 50 square feet per person which is substantially below the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air conditioning Engineers recommended 143 square feet per person. Stuffy air complaints in the fifth building prompted CO2 spot checks. The CO2 level in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning supply was 450 to 550 ppm, while the level was as high as 950 ppm in the building. An investigation revealed tampering with the variable air volume control boxes. It was concluded that CO2 measurement can provide a quick verification of outside air supply rates and air distribution.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

PubChem uses the Hill system whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

There were no differences in body wt grain between NiO exposure groups and controls. Nickel concn in lung of exposure groups were much higher than those of controls and decreased with increased clearance time. No apparent deposition of nickel was observed in the liver, kidney, spleen, and blood immediately after the exposure, but in the high exposure groups, nickel concn in the liver, spleen, and blood increased slightly with increasing clearance time.

In standard mutation assays, in contrast, they were found to be either inactive or weakly active. In our in vitro mutation studies in a lacI transgenic embryonic fibroblast cell line, nickel subsulfide (Ni3S2) increased mutation frequency up to 4. 5-fold. We subsequently applied the comet assay and transgenic rodent mutation assays to investigate the DNA damaging effect and mutagenic potential of nickel subsulfide in target cells of carcinogenesis. A 2-h in vitro treatment of freshly isolated mouse nasal mucosa and lung cells with nickel subsulfide clearly induced DNA fragmentation in a concentration dependent manner. The strong effect was not seen in the same cell types following inhalative treatment of mice and rats, leading only in the mouse nasal mucosa to high DNA damage. When the same inhalative treatment was applied to lacZ and lacI transgenic mice and rats, the spontaneous mutation frequency of these target genes in the respiratory tissues was not increased. These results support a recently proposed non-genotoxic model of nickel carcinogenesis, which acts through gene silencing via DNA methylation and chromatin condensation. This model may also explain our in vitro mutation data in the lacI transgenic cell line, in which nickel subsulfide increased mutation frequency, but in about one-third of the mutants, molecular analysis did not reveal any DNA sequence change in the coding region of the lacI gene despite of the phenotypic loss of its function.",

The latter provides a more rapid reaction than the former method. Single whiskers of green nickel oxide have been made by the closed-tube transport method from oxide powder formed by the decomposition of nickel sulfate using hydrochloric acid as the transport gas. Green nickel oxide also is formed by thermal decomposition of nickel carbonate or nickel nitrate at 1000 Â°C. /Green nickel oxide/",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: Some heavy metals are VERY TOXIC POISONS, especially if their salts are very soluble in water (e.g., lead, chromium, mercury, bismuth, osmium, and arsenic). IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center and locate activated charcoal, egg whites, or milk in case the medical advisor recommends administering one of them. Also locate Ipecac syrup or a glass of salt water in case the medical advisor recommends inducing vomiting. Usually, this is NOT RECOMMENDED outside of a physician's care. If advice from a physician is not readily available and the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give the victim a glass of activated charcoal slurry in water or, if this is not available, a glass of milk, or beaten egg whites and IMMEDIATELY transport victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, assure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.  OTHER: Since this chemical is a known or suspected carcinogen you should contact a physician for advice regarding the possible long term health effects and potential recommendation for medical monitoring. Recommendations from the physician will depend upon the specific compound, its chemical, physical and toxicity properties, the exposure level, length of exposure, and the route of exposure.

There is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of metallic nickel and nickel alloys. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of metallic nickel, nickel monoxides, nickel hydroxides and crystalline nickel sulfides. There is limited evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of nickel alloys, nickelocene, nickel carbonyl, nickel salts, nickel arsenides, nickel antimonide, nickel selenides and nickel telluride. There is inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of nickel trioxide, amorphous nickel sulfide and nickel titanate. The Working Group made the overall evaluation on nickel compounds as a group on the basis of the combined results of epidemiological studies, carcinogenicity studies in experimental animals, and several types of other relevant data, supported by the underlying concept that nickel compounds can generate nickel ions at critical sites in their target cells. Overall evaluation: Nickel compounds are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Metallic nickel is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). /Nickel compounds/",

The protective effects of manganese were also investigated.

Rats given nickel subsulfide had a tumor incidence of 2 percent, whereas 46.7 percent of the rats given nickel powder developed tumors. All tumors developed at the injection site. More than 70 percent of the tumor bearing rats died with lung or lymph node metastases within 3 months after the primary tumors were detected. Interferon had little effect on tumor incidence or time to tumor development. Nickel oxide did not induce any tumors. Manganese protected against tumor induction. Only 20 percent of rats given nickel powder plus manganese developed tumors. Rats that developed tumors showed persistent decreases in natural killer cell activity. The lower the natural killer cell activity, the earlier the tumors developed. Manganese almost completely prevented the decrease in PBMC natural killer cell activity when given along with powdered nickel.",

A significant quantity of inhaled material is swallowed following mucocillary clearance from the respiratory tract. Poor personal hygiene *& work practices can contribute to GI exposure. Percutaneous absorption is negligible, quantitatively, but is important in the pathogenesis of contact hypersensitivity. Absorption is related to the solubility of the cmpd, following the general relationships nickel carbonyl> soluble nickel cmpd> insoluble nickel cmpd. ... Studies on hamsters & rats with insoluble nickel oxide showed poor absorption, with retention of much of the material in the lung after several weeks. ... Long term inhalation exposure to ... nickel oxide caused mucosal damage & inflammatory reaction in the respiratory tract of rats, mice & guinea pigs. Epithelial hyperplasia was observed in rats after inhalation exposure to aerosols of ... nickel oxide. High level long term exposure to nickel oxide led to gradually progressive pneumoconiosis in rats. ... Inhalation exposure to black nickel oxide did not induce lung tumors in Syrian golden hamsters (a species resistant to lung carcinogenesis). ... Unidentified /nickel/ oxide preparations ... induced local mesenchymal tumors in a variety of experimental animals after im, sc, ip, intrapleural, intraocular, intraosseous, intrarenal, intra-articular, intratesticular, or intra-adipose admin. No local carcinogenic response was seen in single dose studies ... with two specimens of nickel oxide, especially prepared for carcinogenicity testing ... . ... In studies using repeated intratracheal instillation, ... nickel oxide caused pulmonary tumors. ... Nickel oxide was present in almost all circumstances in which cancer risks were elevated, together with one or more other forms of nickel (nickel subsulfide, soluble nickel, metallic nickel).",

Comparisons between exposures are most reliable when made under similar exposure conditions. In particular, when urine is monitored, contamination of the sample from the dust in the air, workers' clothes, and hands, is a major porblem. The sampling time must be standardized. At present, no clear cut preference can be given to plasma rather than urine or vice versa. With the exception of nickel carbonyl poisoning, no health risk estimation can be performed based on the results of biological monitoring.",

Groups of 65 male and 65 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 0.62, 1.25, or 2.5 mg nickel oxide/cu m (equivalent to 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg nickel/cu m) by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 104 wk. ... 2 YEAR STUDY IN MICE: ... Groups of 74 to 79 B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg nickel oxide/cu m by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 104 wk. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2 year inhalation studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of nickel oxide in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) and increased incidences of benign or malignant pheochromocytoma (combined) of the adrenal medulla. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of nickel oxide in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) and increased incidences of benign pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of nickel oxide in male B6C3Fl mice exposed to 1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg/cu m. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of nickel oxide in female B6C3Fl mice based on marginally increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma in 2.5 mg/cu m females and of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 1.25 mg/cu m females.",

Challenge 2 weeks later, consisting of 0.2 mL dermal applications of 1.0% aqueous nickel oxide (the maximal non-irritating dose in range-finding study) at virgin sites under occluded binder for 24 hours, induced no erythema in the nickel sulfate-induced pigs. Relative to vehicle control (mean erythema score of 0.1 at 24 hours only) and based on an extension of a Mantel-Haenszel Procedure of analysis, the authors concluded that nickel sulfate did not cause dermal sensitization to nickel oxide challenge in the Guinea Pig Maximization Test.",

The 2-week study established exposure limits to be used in 90-day and chronic exposure studies. Treatment produced no clinical signs of toxicity and no increased mortality throughout the course of study. Relative and absolute lung weights were significantly increased in both 10 and 30 mg/cu m exposure groups. Upon terminal necropsy, gross lesions were limited to enlargement of bronchial lymph nodes in 4/10 high-dose rats; however, histological investigation revealed lesions of the lungs (all exposure levels), bronchial lymph nodes (10, 30 mg/cu m), mediastinal lymph nodes (30 mg/cu m), thymus (10, 30 mg/cu m), and nasal epithelium (30 mg/cu m). In the lung, lesions were widespread in high-dose rats and characterized by hyperplasia, vacuolation, or vesiculation of alveolar macrophages, pigmented particles in alveoli and alveolar macrophages, focal purulent inflammation of alveoli and alveolar septa, hyperplasia and focal interstitial cellular infiltrates of peribronchial lymphoid tissue. Macrophage numbers were increased in many areas of the lungs. Lymphocytic hypertrophy was identified in mediastinal lymph nodes and, in the paracortical regions of the bronchial lymph nodes, accounted for gross enlargement noted on necropsy. Rats of a high exposures also exhibited degenerative changes of the cortical thymus (10, 30 mg/cu m) and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium (30 mg/cu m). Changes in the lungs, bronchial lymph nodes, and thymus were similar, but of lesser intensity and seen in fewer animals of lower level nickel oxide aerosol exposures.",

No significant treatment-related clinical signs of toxicity or bodyweight changes were noted. Upon terminal necropsy, the gross lesions were limited to enlarged bronchial lymph nodes in 4/10 high-exposure mice and atrophied and grayed right intermediate lobes on the lung of a solitary male mouse of a 30 mg/cu m exposure. Histological investigation of the bronchial nodes revealed hyperplasia of lymphocytes in the paracortical regions of the highest exposure group only. Lungs of this group exhibited focal mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in the interstitium near the vessels, bronchial epithelial hyperplasia (non-ciliated cells), and diffuse alveolar macrophage hyperplasia. These changes were severe only in the 30 mg/cu m male mouse exhibiting gross lesions of the right intermediate lobe. The alveoli of this bronchial lobe contained many particles and macrophages, often vacuolated or necrotic with multiple neutrophils, and showed degenerative changes of the epithelium. Alveolar macrophages were often enlarged and their numbers were moderately increased. Bronchial lesions were also noted in mice of exposures below 30 mg/cu m; however, they were characterized primarily by alveolar macrophage hyperplasia (10 - 30 mg/cu m) and pigmented particles within the alveolar macrophages (2.5 - 30 mg/cu m); these exposure-related changes were of lesser intensity than that seen in association with the high-level exposure to nickel oxide aerosol.",

Treatment produced no distinct clinical signs of toxicity, hematology anomalies (15-month interim evaluation), or increased mortality relative to control; however, mean bodyweights of exposed 5.0 mg/cu m females were minimally reduced in the second year of study relative to controls. Incidence of chronic respiratory tract inflammation and pigmentation generally increased in a dose-dependent manner at 7 and 15 months in both males and females, and a minimal bronchialization (alveolar epithelial hyperplasia) and proteinosis were first noted at 15 months. At 2 years, chronic inflammation, bronchialization, and proteinosis were significantly (p </= 0.05, Williams' or Dunnett's test) more prevalent in exposed groups than in controls. Pigmentation of the lungs was universal throughout treatment groups. Upon histologic review after 2 years, females of 1.25 mg/cu m exposures exhibited significantly increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas (combined) and 2.5 mg/cu m females showed increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas relative to controls. Lymphoid hyperplasia first occurred in one each of 1.25 mg/cu m females and 2.5 mg/cu m males at 7 months, in males of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/cu m exposures and all females at 15 months. At the 2-year assessment, a dose-dependent relationship for lymphoid hyperplasia was apparent and bronchial lymph node pigmentation was nearly universal in all treatment groups. Tissue burden analysis documented significantly increased concentrations of nickel in the lungs of exposed mice at 7 and 15 months (7 months, 162-1034 ug nickel/g lung; 15 months, 331-2,258 ug/g), these levels rising in both a dose- and time- dependent manner.

Treatment produced no distinct clinical signs of toxicity, hematology anomalies (15-month interim evaluation), or increased mortality relative to control. Mean bodyweights during the second year of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/cu m exposures in both males and females, however, were minimally reduced relative to controls. On interim sacrifice at 7 and 15 weeks, absolute and relative lung weights were significantly (p </= 0.05, Williams' or Dunnett's test) higher in these groups. Most exposed rats exhibited chronic inflammation of the lung at 7 and 15 months, the dose-dependent increased incidence of statistical significance relative to controls in both males and females at 2 years' assessment. Atypical bronchialization (alveolar epithelial hyperplasia) was also generally enhanced with increasing exposure level in males and females at 2 years. Increased alveolar pigmentation in exposed rats relative to controls reached statistical significance at 7 months and persisted in all treatment groups throughout the study. Upon 2-year terminal sacrifice, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas in 1.25 mg/cu m females and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas (combined) in 1.25 and 2.5 mg/cu m males were significantly increased relative to controls. Bronchiolar lymphoid hyperplasia first observed in 1.25 and 2.5 mg/cu m males and females at 7 months, was generally increased with exposure level at 2 years. Pigmentation of the bronchial lymph nodes appeared in all exposure groups except 0.62 mg/cu m males and females at 7 months. Additionally, increases in pheochromocytoma and adrenal medulla hyperplasia were statistically significant at 2 years in 2.5 mg/cu m females, as benign or malignant pheochromocytoma (combined) was in the 2.5 mg/cu m male rats.
